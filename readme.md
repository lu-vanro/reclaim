# Reclaim â€“ A Gentle Wellbeing App

## ðŸŒ¿ Project Overview
**Reclaim** is a gentle wellbeing web app that helps people make rest a regular, intentional part of their lives. It avoids typical productivity features and instead focuses on helping users build pressure-free habits around rest.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem & Inspiration
Reclaim was inspired by the growing issue of time poverty, especially among young adults balancing work, study, and personal commitments. It aims to support users who feel like theyâ€™re constantly falling short by encouraging a mindset that prioritises regular rest.

## âœ¨ Key Features & User Flows
- Select 3â€“5 rest goals to guide your experience
- Daily reminders to rest with no pressure or gamification
- No scores, timers, or social sharingâ€”just intentional rest
