# Reclaim – A Gentle Wellbeing App

## 🌿 Project Overview
**Reclaim** is a gentle wellbeing web app that helps people make rest a regular, intentional part of their lives. It avoids typical productivity features and instead focuses on helping users build pressure-free habits around rest.

## 💡 Problem & Inspiration
Reclaim was inspired by the growing issue of time poverty, especially among young adults balancing work, study, and personal commitments. It aims to support users who feel like they’re constantly falling short by encouraging a mindset that prioritises regular rest.

## ✨ Key Features & User Flows
- Select 3–5 rest goals to guide your experience
- Daily reminders to rest with no pressure or gamification
- No scores, timers, or social sharing—just intentional rest

## 🔧 Instructions
- To run locally, open `index.html` in a browser
- To view the live site: https://lu-vanro-reclaim.netlify.app
- Press **F1** at any time to reset the app and go back to the starting page

## 🐞 Known Issues & Limitations
- Slow Loading on Netlify: The live site takes longer to load compared to the local version.
- The "Create an Account" page is a placeholder for demo purposes. Account creation and login functionality have been intentionally skipped as they are not essential to the app's core experience.
- The mailing list form is functional and connects to the demo database.
- On the homepage where users select a rest goal, only the "Read a Book" option is currently implemented. The remaining goals are placeholders and not yet interactive.
